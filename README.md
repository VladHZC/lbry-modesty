# Modesty.py better managment of you lbry names 

I wanted to unlock tips, but everytime you do that you lose ranking on LBRY apps. So I use that @BrendonBrewer made to check the names I lost search ranking. 

But now I have 1056 claims under my account so I decided to make a few customizations so I could check only the ones I need to take care, to save time, I started ~~surfing~~ skating the internet and found this cool python library called [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) and sorry Brendon I made a little carnival on the Terminal, couldn't hold myself, it also uses `json` and `requests` so if you don't have that `pip` those.

So, reviewing: 

1) You need python to run it 
2) Check the requirements `rich`, `requests` and `json`
3) Run it with along with LBRY app or lbrynet 
4) You will get the list of posts that could be performing better if you stake more than the winning bid amount 
5) It exports a .txt with more details, including reposts heritage from vanity.py 


> Will try to make it executable soon :smile:
